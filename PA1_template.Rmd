## Loading and preprocessing the data
    ###In this preprocessing step, working directory was set, data was unzipped and lattice package 
    is being utilized
```{r}
getwd()
setwd("C:/Users/Suresh/RepData_PeerAssessment1")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "character", "numeric"))
head(activity)
names(activity)
library(lattice)
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
StepsTotal <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(StepsTotal$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "green")
mean(StepsTotal$steps)
median(StepsTotal$steps)

```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
