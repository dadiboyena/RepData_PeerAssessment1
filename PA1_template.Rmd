## Loading and preprocessing the data
###In this preprocessing step, the working directory was set, data was unzipped and lattice is being utilized
```{r}
getwd()
setwd("C:/Users/Suresh/RepData_PeerAssessment1")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "character", "numeric"))
head(activity)
names(activity)
library(lattice)
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
